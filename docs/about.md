# About

I'm Berk, an IT engineer based in Vienna, Austria, with hands-on expertise in on-premise, AWS and Azure cloud infrastructure. My focus is on building reliable, scalable systems using modern infrastructure-as-code practices and cloud-native technologies.

    <h2>What This Blog Is About</h2>
    <p>On infrabytes.dev, I write about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Practical infrastructure challenges</strong> real-world problems I encounter when managing Kubernetes clusters and cloud deployments</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure patterns</strong> solutions that have worked in production, with examples and trade-offs</li>
      <li><strong>Tools and frameworks</strong> deep dives into the tools I use daily (Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Automation and scaling</strong> making infrastructure reliable and efficient at any scale</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

I try to avoid vendor lock-in and prefer choosing open-source agnostic choices instead. I tend to put thought into the work I do and make sure that my solutions are going to work long-term, and deal with problems before they become problems. In other words, I enjoy fighting an uphill battle with little chance of true victory.
