# About

I'm Berk, an IT engineer with hands-on expertise in on-premise, AWS and Azure cloud infrastructure. My focus is on building reliable, scalable systems using modern infrastructure-as-code practices and cloud-native technologies.

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Kubernetes** — cluster bootstrapping, management, and operations at scale
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform/OpenTofu, Terragrunt for reproducible infrastructure
- **CI/CD Pipelines** — designing and implementing automation workflows with tools like GitHub Actions
- **Configuration Management** — Ansible and other tools for system automation
- **Linux Server Administration** — hardening, monitoring, and managing production systems
- **AWS & On-Premise Infrastructure** — designing and deploying hybrid cloud solutions

## What This Blog Is About

On infrabytes.dev, I write about:

- **Practical infrastructure challenges** — the real-world problems you encounter when managing Kubernetes clusters and cloud deployments
- **Infrastructure patterns** — solutions that have worked in production, with examples and trade-offs
- **Tools and frameworks** — deep dives into the tools I use daily (Terraform, Helm, Kubernetes, etc.)
- **Automation and scaling** — making infrastructure reliable and efficient at any scale

I avoid vendor-lock-in thinking and prefer portable, battle-tested solutions. I tend to put thought into the work I do and make sure that my solutions are going to work long-term, and deal with problems before they become problems. In other words, I enjoy fighting an uphill battle with little chance of true victory.
